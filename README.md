# Algorithm

<li>PPO - The Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm combines ideas from A2C (having multiple workers) and TRPO (it uses a trust region to improve the actor).</li>
<li>A2C - A synchronous, deterministic variant of Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C). It uses multiple workers to avoid the use of a replay buffer.</li>
<li>SAC - Soft Actor Critic (SAC) Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor.</li>

# Stock-Trading-Environment

A custom OpenAI gym environment for simulating stock trades on historical price data.

Steps to run -

      For PLOT - python stocktrade.py -a 'SAC' -t 100
      For LIVE - python stock_live.py -a 'PPO' -t 100000

you can provide any algo [-a]: PPO / A2C / SAC & [-t]: timesteps
